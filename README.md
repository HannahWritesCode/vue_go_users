My capstone project I did for an [internship at Adventure Travel Trade Association](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hannahwritescode/).

The backend is written in Go, the frontend in Vue.js, data stored in a MySQL database (and cached in Redis), with reverse proxying done with Nginx. For security, only hashed passwords are stored and authentication is done with JSON web tokens.
